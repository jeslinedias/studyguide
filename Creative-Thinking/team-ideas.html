                        <strong class="text-blue-700">Concept:</strong> In face-to-face team discussions, individuals must wait their turn to speak, leading to a bottleneck.

                        <strong class="text-blue-700">Impact:</strong> People may forget their ideas while waiting, or the conversation may move on, rendering their ideas irrelevant. This results in a loss of valuable ideas that would emerge if individuals worked alone.

Consequently, critical information or alternative perspectives are withheld, and mistaken perceptions persist.

                        <strong class="text-blue-700">Concept:</strong> Despite the numerous barriers, people often *feel* more creative when working in teams, even if the actual creative output is lower than individual work.

                        <li><strong class="text-blue-700">Social Enjoyment:</strong> Team interactions are often fun, engaging, and provide social connection (laughter, conversation). This enjoyment can be confused with actual creativity.</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-blue-700">Perceived Buy-in/Commitment:</strong> Being part of the discussion can lead to a feeling of ownership and commitment to the outcome, regardless of the creative process.</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-blue-700">Reinforcement of Ideas:</strong> Team members often complement each other's ideas and provide positive feedback ("That's a great idea!"), which boosts individual confidence and the perception of collective creativity, even if critical evaluation is lacking.</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-blue-700">Collective Memory:</strong> Teams can help in remembering solutions or ideas that might have been forgotten if individuals worked alone, as seen in the Post-It Note example.</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-blue-700">"Team Player" Mentality:</strong> The organizational emphasis on being a "team player" can lead to a culture where criticism is avoided and support is prioritized, which feels good but might not foster true creative challenge.</li>

This discrepancy between perception and reality makes it challenging to address the underlying issues that hinder team creativity.</p>
